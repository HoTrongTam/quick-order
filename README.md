# Quick Order Mobile Screen

## How to run
1. npx create-expo-app quick-order
2. cd quick-order
3. npm install react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons
3. Coppy assets, components, context folder and App.js file to project quick-order
4. Run `npm install and npm start` to run and start the app.

## Framework and State Management
- React Native for mobile app development.
- React Context API for state management.

## Features
- **Product List**: Displays products with prices and categories.
- **Search & Filter**: Search products and filter by category.
- **Quick Order Summary**: Shows cart summary, including total items, quantity, and amount.

## Trade-offs
If I had more time, I would:
- Improve UI/UX design with custom components or libraries.
- Implement persistence (e.g., local storage for cart data).
- Add more advanced validation (e.g., limit quantity to 99 per item).
